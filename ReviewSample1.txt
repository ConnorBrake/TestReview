I have cleaned my whole car and couch with this. My parents had one and it worked great so I bought one too. However it does leak out of the bottom I’m not sure what that’s about because that’s not supposed to happen but you can easily suck that water back up. Great power. Easy to clean and use. Has furniture looking brand new.
